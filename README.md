Monty is a simple interpreter for the Monty bytecode language. It reads Monty files of bytecode instructions and interprets them. Monty files have the ".m" extension and contain one instruction per line. There is also an interactive mode for testing purposes.

Compilation & Output :

    Your code will be compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty

    Any output must be printed on stdout
    Any error message must be printed on stderr
        Here is a link to a GitHub repository that could help you making sure your errors are printed on stderr
